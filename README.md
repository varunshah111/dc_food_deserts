### Mapping DC’s Food Deserts using Geo-Spatial Programming


#### The UN defines a food desert as an area in which ⅓ of the population lives more than 1 mile away from the nearest grocery store. Washington, DC’s food deserts are particularly suited to MCE analysis using programming in Geopandas due to the inherently multifaceted nature of food accessibility.

#### Food accessibility in DC is limited by both the physical distance that people have to travel to reach their nearest grocery store and the relative poverty levels of the people in those neighborhoods.

#### For this project, we used percentage of the population making between 20,000 to 35,000/yr and spending more than 30% of their income on rent. In non-rent-burdened areas, we assume that most people are able to afford cars to drive to their nearest grocery while living outside the 1 mile buffer.
